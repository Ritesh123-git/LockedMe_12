Steps Involved in creating this project.

1- I have divided my project into four section, first one--LockedMeMain file from where my program execute, second--File Operations which contain all the operation 
which we have to perform in a file 3rd one--HandleOptions file which we decide according to our input which operation to be get called and what operation to be 
performed 4th one- MenuOptions which will contain all the respective method through we will accomplish our task that we have to perform on a file.

2- In the LockedMeMain file Calling the three mathod which we create a folder in the main directory, print the name of the developer and the third one will take us
to the welcome screen and will decide which respective operation we have to perform.

3- In the welcomescreenInput we set the boolean true so the switch case may execute till the user want to exit the application. And in the method 3 cases we will run,
the first one is displayAllfiles, the 2nd one is HandleFileMenuOptions which will run another Switch case which will contain 5 Cases, the 1st one is Adding a file to 
the main folder, deleting a file from the main folder, searching a file from the main folder, showing a previous menu, and the last one is exiting from a program.

4- We have created methods like printWelcomeScreen, displaymenu, displayFileMenuOptions in MenuOption.java file.

5-We have created methods like displayAllFiles, listFilesInDirectory to set the file in ascending order, createFile, displayFileLocations, searchFileRecursively, 
deleteFileRecursively.

6- Through this 5 Basic structure steps we can achieve our functionalities which the project required to complete it requirement.
